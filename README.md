# Surreal Estate by Dean Spooner üè†

This is a React web application that allows users to browse and search through different properties, supplied by an external API. Users will be able to:

- use a "Listings Page" to search for different properties and sort/filter the results;

- view details on a particular property with its own "Property Details" page;

- add properties through a dedicated "Add Property" page.

This project is currently being built as part of the Manchester Codes front-end module.
